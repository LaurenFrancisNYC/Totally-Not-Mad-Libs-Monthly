# Totally-Not-Mad-Libs-Monthly

Totally Not Mad Libs Daily is a React and Airtable build that will present users with a montly mad lib style prompt, in which they can submit responses that they deem the funniest. They can see the responses of other uses, and press a 'like' button on the other responses. Each month, the response(s) with the most likes are added to a "Hall of Fame" page where they can be viewed.
