# Totally-Not-Mad-Libs-Monthly

Totally Not Mad Libs Monthly (TNMLM) is a React and Airtable build that will present users with a montly mad lib style prompt, in which they can submit responses that they deem the funniest. They can see the responses of other uses, and press a 'like' button on the other responses. Each month, the response(s) with the most likes are added to a "Hall of Fame" page, where each month's prompt and the most liked response can be viewed.

#Wire Frames

The wireframes below depict the homepage, entry page, and hall of fame page feed for TNMLM in web and phone format. The homepage contains a header displaying the app title and three clickable icons - add submission, view subbmission for the current month, and view the Hall of Fame- that route to each respective page. The review feeds contain an input form and submit button for review data. Below the form is a feed of all past forms, along with a delete button for each post. The screens will center as screen size decreases.

SWOT Analysis
Strengths:
I have a solid idea how I'll structure my items - a primary API entry for each month, with arrays to keep track of responses and likes. I believe I can use JS's ability to to get the current date to figure out which prompt to display. This was a tough idea to parse out initially! 

Weaknesses:
React as a whole is still a bit blurry for me - I'm confident I can make this work, but planning it without getting my hands on VSCode is a bit hard to do.

Opportunities:
I hope this will give me a much better grasp on React as a whole, and the general best practices of where and how compoenents are laid out. Again, I'm not foreign to it, but it is hard to visualize not during the act.

Threats:
I don't want to bite off more than I can chew. I am a bit unsure how to get the 'like' button to work without causing refreshes, but I have a backup plan of a 'submit votes' button if need be.
